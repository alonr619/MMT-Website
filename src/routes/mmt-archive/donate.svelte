            <p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 5px">Mustang Math is a <b>501(c)(3) nonprofit</b> organization composed entirely of <b>high school and college volunteers</b>. 
                We are incredibly passionate about providing middle school students with access to collaborative, challenging, and creative math tournaments, events, and classes.
                However, while our volunteers put countless hours of time into Mustang Math, in order to provide high quality events and enable our resources to be accessed by as many students as possible,
                we have a multitude of costs, including but not limited to venue booking, technology services, and teaching resources. Your donation will be attributed directly towards these costs allowing us
                to work towards our goal of <b>charging minimal to no registration fees</b> for our services.
