# Instructions for Setting up Local Environment 
1. Clone repo. You can use either terminal or GitHub Desktop.
2. If you use VSCode, you can install the Svelte plugin.
3. Install `npm`, if you haven't already.
4. Run the command `npm install`.
5. Run the local server using the command `npm run dev -- --open`.
6. Start coding! :)

# Repository
The `static` folder contains static content, like the about us images and past tests.

The `src` folder contains `lib` and `routes`. `routes` is where the src code for each of pages are, and `lib` contains the `components` and some other `.js` files, among other things. What's important is the `components` folder which has all the different components that the website uses.

# Contributing
To contribute, choose an issue from the Taskade to work on and create a new branch. Once you're happy with your changes, create a pull request from your branch to `staging`. I'll look over your commits and ask for changes if necessary. After that, the `staging` branch will be reviewed by other teams. If everything is alright, it'll be merged to `main` and deployed to prod.
